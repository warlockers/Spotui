## Features

It connects to your real Spotify account and mirrors the Spotify experience.

- 🎵 **Playlists** — browse, play, add/remove tracks, create new playlists, all synced with your Spotify account
- 📝 **Lyrics** — Spotify's own synced lyrics, with a live preview on the player and a full-screen view
- 📻 **Spotify recommendations** — the queue continues with Spotify's real track radio (autoplay), so "up next" matches what open.spotify.com would play
- ❤️ Liked songs, followed artists, listening history and downloads (including lossless FLAC)

### 🌟 What's Different in This Fork?
This fork adds debugging for audio playback. When the streaming quality is set lower than 'High', playback issues occur, including audio stuttering, skipping to the next track, and other glitches.
